## What It Does
Web game application for promotion of [LionBear Coffee Roasters](https://jina-sw.github.io/LionBear.github.io/). The teddy bear collects beans to score high. The mouse clicks control the movements of the teddy bear. The coffee beans appear randomly and vertically move up in the game window. If the teddy bear touches a coffee bean moving around, the score counter increases by 1.

## Tech Stacks
HTML (Layout), CSS (Design), Javascript (functionality)

## Accomplishments I am proud of
This is my first game development project I spent hours and hours to make it properly work. I picked a cute bear character and a bean image to have it align with the business narrative of [LionBear Coffee Roasters](https://jina-sw.github.io/LionBear.github.io/). 

## Future Improvement
- Now, LionBear Coffee Roasters website and BearRewards are two separate applications. If I integrate two apps into one creating a dedicated category for this game on the LionBear Coffee Roasters website, they would look united.
- Sign-up and Sign-in features are good to have! This is important for customers who visit the website frequently to have them receive a customized experience - for example, saving past game records.
